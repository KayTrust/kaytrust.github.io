# About KayTrust

KayTrust is a complete digital identity solution comprised of:

- A set of technical specifications based on Internet standards
- Reference implementations:
  - A mobile Wallet for users (free of charge)
  - Java and Javascript/NodeJS libraries to make integration easier for developers
  - An enterprise server suite for organisations that wish to issue their own credentials with minimal effort

## Decentralised identity

It is important to understand the vision behind self-sovereign identity: **nobody (no company, not any government, etc.) may control, block, censure, delete or spoof users' identity, restrict what users may do with their identity, or access information that users didn't agree to share.**

KayTrust achieves that by using a **decentralised trust repository** (typically a blockchain) for identities, for credential proofs, and for sharing consent. The repository itself only stores proofs of data integrity. No private information is stored on the shared repository, so KayTrust works on public repositories such as public blockchains.

For more information, please visit [kaytrust.id](https://www.kaytrust.id/).

## What does the developer space offer?

The purpose of this space is to make life easy for developers. You will find:
- A reference for KayTrust specification
- Library references such as Javadoc
- Swagger documentation for APIs

This developer space is new, so please bear with us!
