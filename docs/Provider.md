# Introduction
KayTrust Provider is a web application and a set of APIs that let individuals and organizations manage their digital identifiers (DIDs) and create, hold and exchange verifiable credentials (VCs).

It is modular and can be extended with tailored identity-related features.

It provides an easy user interface:
- For individuals as a web wallet.
- For small or large organizations, as a multi-user application.

KayTrust Provider, like most applications, needs to [authenticate its users](/KayTrust-Provider/User-account-management) against an IAM service. KayTrust Provider works with any IAM service compliant with OAuth 2.0.
