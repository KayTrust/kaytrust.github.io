# Recover your identity

Lets imagine the situation where you no longer can access your device(s). In such scenario you can still recover your DID.
In order to perform this process you can set a trusted third party with an "devicemanager" capability. In case of "disaster" scenarios you can contact the third party which after an offline check process can set a new device("newdevice") through the "adding a new device process" explained above; after that you can access your already existing identifier with your "newdevice".

As a product, [KayTrust](https://www.kaytrust.id/) (a trusted third party) has a set of tools that can help you benefit of the user friendly interfaces to guide you in this process.
