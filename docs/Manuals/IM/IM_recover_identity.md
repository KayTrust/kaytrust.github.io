# Recover your identity

Lets imagine the situation where you no longer can access your device(s) so you not able to access your identity, in such scenario you can still recover it.

If you have deployed your identity through an Identity Manager, the recovery process is as simple as contacting the **entity** who owns the Identity Manager contract, which after an offchain checking process can help you set a new device om the Identity Manager contract to access your already blockchain existing identity.

If your deploy your identity with our Identity Manager contract owned by [Kaytrust](https://www.kaytrust.id/) then the recovery process have well implemented user friendly interfaces to guide you in this process.
