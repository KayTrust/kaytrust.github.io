# Recover your identity

Lets imagine the situation where you no longer can access your device(s) and thus not able to access your identity; in such scenario you can still recover it.

If you have deployed your identity through an Identity Manager, the recovery process is as simple as contacting the **entity** who owns the Identity Manager contract, which after an offchain checking process can help you set a new device om the Identity Manager contract to access your already blockchain existing identity.

If your deploy your identity with our Identity Manager contract owned by [Kaytrust](https://www.kaytrust.id/), you can benefit of the user friendly interfaces to guide you in this process.
